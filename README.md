Running the app if you are on WINDOWS (If you are on MAC/LINUX scroll down)

    Step 1:
    Install the project files(ZIP) from github.

    Step 2:
    Extract the "Client and Software App" folder from the zip folder (You can place it anywhere you want)

    Step 3:
    Go To: "Client and Software App" >> "Executables"
    You should see the following files: Server1.bat; Server2.bat; Server3.bat; Client.bat
    (You can ignore the other files however do NOT delete them)

    Step 4:
    Run Server1.bat, Server2.bat, Server3.bat (double click the files to run them)
    You should see a terminal window pop up for each of them, where it is written: 
    "Waiting for client"

    Step 5:
    Run Client.bat
    Important: You need to run ALL server instances (step 3) before running the client, otherwisee the client terminal will CRASH

    Step 6:
    After doing Step 3 and 4, you should see the message "Client Connected" on all server terminals and the message "Enter a number:" on client terminal.

    You may enter any number, and one of the randomly picked servers will display that number doubled. 
    IMPORTANT: If you enter a non-number(string) the application will CRASH

    Step 7:
    You may exit by simply closing the client terminal window, and all the server terminals will close automatically.
